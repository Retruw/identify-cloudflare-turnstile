# What is Cloudflare Turnstile?
Cloudflare Turnstile is an alternative to traditional CAPTCHA services, designed to verify user interactions without disrupting user experience. It offers a less intrusive method for websites to determine whether a visitor is a human or a bot.

Cloudflare offers **three types** of Turnstile integrations:

1. **Managed Challenge**:
   - This is a no-interaction-required verification system that automatically determines if a user is a bot or human, often without the user needing to perform any tasks.
   - It uses behavioral signals and browser characteristics to assess users.

2. **Interactive Challenge**:
   - If the Managed Challenge is uncertain, an Interactive Challenge, which might involve simple tasks for the user, is presented.
   - This is similar to traditional CAPTCHA but aims to be less intrusive.

3. **Invisible Turnstile:**
    - Fully Background Operation: Functions entirely in the background without any required user action.
    - Automated User Verification: Employs advanced algorithms to analyze user behavior seamlessly and decide on user authenticity.
    - Non-Disruptive: Ensures security checks do not interfere with the user experience, maintaining smooth website interaction.

### Features of Cloudflare Turnstile include:
- **Ease of Integration**: It can be integrated with minimal changes to existing websites.
- **Improved User Experience**: It reduces the need for interactive tests, aiming to provide a seamless experience.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Works across various platforms and devices.
- **Privacy-focused**: Does not rely on invasive personal data tracking.

Cloudflare Turnstile focuses on maintaining security and usability by leveraging advanced techniques like machine learning to minimize the need for active user interaction, making it a modern solution for preventing automated abuse.
